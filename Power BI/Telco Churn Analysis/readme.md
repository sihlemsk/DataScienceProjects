# Overview of Customer Churn Dashboard

## Introduction
This is an overview of the customer churn dashboard developed using the Power BI platform. This dashboard is an insight into the various parameters that describe customer churn within a telecommunication firm. The report utilizes different data visualization methodologies to present a comprehensive analysis of the factors that impact customer churning so that the stakeholders may take measures and make decisions towards increasing the rate of customer retention.

## Key Features
### Total Churn Rate
Donut Chart: This expresses the aggregate churn rate, with the percentage of customers who have cancelled the service taken against those who are still using it. This high-level metric is very important for knowledge about the extent of churning in the customer base.

### Demographic Analysis
Churn Count by Gender: Bar charts showing the churn rate broken down by gender to understand if there are large differences in churning among male and female customers.
Churn Count by Partner Status: This will allow for the analysis of whether customers with or without partners have a high or low churn rate.
Churn Count by Senior Citizen Status: Segments the churn rate between senior citizens and non-senior citizens. This gives a view of age-based trends of churning behavior.
Churn Count by Dependents Status: The case where the customer has dependents should be seen to result in higher or lower churning compared to a case without.

### Service Usage Analysis
Churn Count by Internet Service: The churn rate for the different kinds of internet services that a company has to offer; for example, fiber optic versus DSL. This tells which of the services are churning at higher rates than others.
Churn Count by Tech Support: Churn in respect to tech support usageâ€”that is, whether tech support satisfaction has anything to do with customer retention.
Churn Count by Online Security: Churn rates as segmented on the basis of usage of online security services, pointing out how this affects the churning.
Contract and Payment Analysis
Churn Count by Contract Type: This reflects the count of churning based on various contracted months such as month-to-month, one-year, two-year, indicating how contract terms influence customer loyalty.
Churn Count by Payment Method: This shows, across a number of different payment methods, like electronic check or mailed check, if convenience in paying is what affects churn.

### Monthly Charges
Average Monthly Charges: A comparison of the average monthly charges between the churned and non-churned customers by various contract types, gender, senior citizens, dependents status. This would let one see if it's the pricing that's truly at fault.
Sum of Monthly Charges by Churn: A view of the total of monthly charges from the churned vs non-churned customers; this puts things into a financial perspective on the churn.

### Tenure Analysis
Churn Count and Non-Churn Count by Tenure: An area chart for the distribution of the counts of customers who have churned or not, by their tenure. This can be used to indicate possible trends in customer loyalty over time.
Average Tenure: This provides an average of how long customers usually stick around before they churn.

The Power BI dashboard provides an all-around outlook on customer churn, using each segment and different visualizations to point out trends and those areas where this evolution can be improved. By analyzing demographics, service usage, type of contract, type of payment, monthly charges, and tenure, stakeholders will be well-equipped to go ahead and come up with effective strategies for reducing churn and increasing customer retention.
