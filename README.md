As a lifelong learner, I'm eager to work with others to enhance my abilities.<br><br>I'm looking for help with connecting with professionals in the field to gain insights on transitioning from academics to a career in business analytics. Mentorship opportunities focused on leveling up technical abilities and soft skills would be invaluable.<br><br>Ask me about my experience providing technical support and troubleshooting software issues in a remote work setting.
